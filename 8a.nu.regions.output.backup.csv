There are 2 distinct rock types here offering roofs, caves, eggs, slabs, faces, highballs, blocky overhangs and laser cut 45s,  as well as dumpy lips, choss, mosquitoes, polish, tourists, graffiti, trash, rare plants, fossils and jet black squirrels.  All this within a few klicks of the mighty Niagara Falls.  \r\rThe Niagara Glen experiences all 4 seasons to their fullest relative potentials, so plan accordingly.  (i.e. summer is hot and humid, spring is rainy, fall is perfect, winter is cold).  \r\rHere you'll find a rather large collection of limestone blocks which have mainly fallen from the headwall above and subsequently come to rest on the Canadian portion of the Niagara Gorge.  There is as well a healthy smattering of sandstone deposited below the limestone layer appearing closer to the river which manifest as both \"cave\" and water-worn egg like blocks, some of which protrude from the gorgeside.  \r\rAn interesting aside: It is thought by some geologists that significant portions of the Niagara River Gorge were cut by the Falls in a mere matter of weeks as the falls crushed their way from lake Ontario towards lake Erie.  Much of the limestone/dolostone here is over 400 million years old and is full of fossil remnants.\r\rThis area, like most areas, offers a large range of rock quality.  All I can say is that the best lines are quite good.  The grades currently range from v0 to v12 and the usual potentials abound.  It has been said that the moderate grades are better represented here than the harder lines, and while there may be a modicum of truth to this statement, for the avid boulderer,  this is likely an outdated sentiment.  Indeed, there are classics at all levels if you know where to look.  \r\rThis being said, the Glen encompasses a somewhat large area covering several kilometers from end to end and while there are a number of dense concentrations, much of the climbing is spread out.  The classics of each grade may be hidden at first but the intrepid will surely reward themselves with quality bouldering and its associated stoke.\r\rAn important word about Access etc: It should be said that the Glen boulders live in a very special climatic zone known as a Carolinian forest (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolinian_forest) which houses rare plant and animal species protected by the Provincial Nature Preserve in which it resides.  The Niagara Glen is apparently home to some of the only remaining Carolinian Forest in all of Canada. Local climbers have worked exceedingly hard with land managers to secure access to the bouldering in exchange for some basic behavior modifications.  These modifications largely revolve around common sense as it applies to delicate organisms in addition to other user groups (see \"Access Information/Issues\" to the left) and should be explored further via the Ontario Access Coalition website (www.ontarioaccesscoalition.com) prior to visiting the area.","Access":"","Country":"Canada","City":"Niagara Falls, Ontario"}{"Ascents":188,"Id":33304,"Name":"Kalamarka","Position":[48.60533,19.41825],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"Slovakia","City":"Detva"}{"Ascents":168,"Id":27769,"Name":"Kalim askan","Position":[53.60758112477209,56.650657653808594],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"Russia","City":"Makarovo"}{"Ascents":303,"Id":27843,"Name":"Lilla essingen","Position":[59.32508962522229,18.008995056152344],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"Sweden","City":"Stockholm"}{"Ascents":85,"Id":33688,"Name":"Lilla långevik","Position":[58.28167459993807,11.430877447128296],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"Sweden","City":"Lysekil"}{"Ascents":162,"Id":30495,"Name":"Lillgalten","Position":[62.17575962070837,17.53040313720703],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"Sweden","City":"Sundsvall"}{"Ascents":522,"Id":22693,"Name":"Lillsjön","Position":[58.66024572418901,16.14664077758789],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"Sweden","City":"Norrköping"}{"Ascents":1520,"Id":27616,"Name":"Lilly boulders","Position":[36.10480359930836,-84.72424507141113],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"United States","City":""}{"Ascents":11,"Id":35769,"Name":"Kalim askan","Position":[53.598092840697966,56.646640162569156],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"Russia","City":""}{"Ascents":90,"Id":31773,"Name":"Quesada","Position":[37.84924,-3.05746],"Info":"http://zonasdeescaladadejaen.blogspot.com.es/p/quesada.html","Access":"http://zonasdeescaladadejaen.blogspot.com.es/p/quesada.html","Country":"España","City":"Quesada (Jaen)"}{"Ascents":265,"Id":30126,"Name":"Kalk bay","Position":[-34.12715278654447,18.440208435058593],"Info":"Rock is smooth quarzitic sandstone.

It is an\rinternational meeting point for climbers from all over the world, who visit not only to enjoy the\rexquisite Kalymnian rock found in virtually all sectors, but for the relaxing, peaceful surroundings\rof the island as well.\rKalymnos is a small island in the Aegean Sea,\rso it can be relatively hard to get there. Travel\roften involves a stayover in Athens or Kos, and\rthe airfare to Kalymnos costs more compared\rto most other climbing areas in Europe. On\rthe other hand, once you get to Kalymnos\rexpenses are low. Getting around the island is\reasy, so a car is not absolutely necessary; accommodation\rand food prices are much lower\rcompared to the rest of Greece and mainland\rEurope; and in most rental studios you can\rprepare your own meals.\rMany visitors have described the equipping of routes on Kalymnos as the epitome of sport climbing.\rAt the moment there are 64 sport crags with close to 2.000\rroutes ranging from F4a to F9a. Many have an athletic, steep and challenging sport climbing character and are\requipped in a sensible and friendly manner using stainless steel bolts.\rThe rock on Kalymnos seems to come in three varieties:\r1. Extremely overhanging rock with blobs, tufas and stalactites which, even when tilted 20\rdegrees past vertical, can still check in at a mere 7a!\r2. Slightly overhanging or vertical, smooth white and orange walls with pockets and smaller\rtufa features.\r3. Grey slabs with sharp rock that has been sculpted by the rain (gouttes) with little iron knobs\rcemented into the matrix.\rThe best of the routes can possibly combine the three types of rock in one pitch.\r\rMore info, news, updates and guidebook at \rwww.climbkalymnos.com","Access":"There are two big climbing shops in Kalymnos: Wild Sport & Kalymnos Adventure Centre & Climbers' Nest who also offers beside climbing courses offers; Caving, Horse riding, Yoga, Massage, Sailing etc.","Country":"Greece","City":"South Aegean region"}{"Ascents":25,"Id":33741,"Name":"Hotel cornus","Position":[40.09652,8.51063],"Info":"ATTENTION!!

Most of the routes (more than 150) are inside the gorge with the oldest ones situated on the beach or near the beach. Here you will find some of the most difficult routes in Crete, up to 8c+, from single to multiple pitches. There are just a few lower than 5c where most of them are around 6a/8a. Almost 90% of the climbing routes are equipped and you will only need quickdraws and 60-70 meters of single rope to repeat them. Having said that, there are also many where natural anchors must be used. Those are usually the first routes in the area opened in late 80s. The place is marvellous and you will enjoy climbing and swimming in one of the most beautiful places not only in Crete but also in Greece!\r\r  Where to stay\r\rDuring the summer you can sleep even without a tent but during the winter having a tent setup is, of course, recommended in order to enjoy more your night. You wont find anything inside the gorge so be prepared to carry a lot of water, especially if you are going there in the summer.\r\r    Climbing Guide:\r \rhttp://www.rockrun.com/product_images/c/549/PB-GU-CRE2_1_zoom__76592_zoom.jpg\r\rhttp://www.climbincrete.com/en/Climbing/Agiofarago/Agiofarago:_Introduction","Access":"","Country":"Greece","City":"Heraklion region"}{"Ascents":12,"Id":34590,"Name":"Agios irakleidhios","Position":[35.023471,33.244103],"Info":"GPS coordinates : \rRock type :\rRock orientation :\rRock inclination :\rAltitude :\rBest season :\rWalking time :\rFamily friendly :\rRoutes style :\rRoutes established :\rRoutes number : \rRoutes height :\rRoutes grade : \rRoutes use :\r\rMore information at:\rhttp://www.cyprusrocks.eu/","Access":"","Country":"Cyprus","City":""}{"Ascents":74,"Id":34882,"Name":"Savvushka","Position":[51.36031,82.20125],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"Russia","City":"Savvushka"}{"Ascents":18,"Id":35421,"Name":"Vercheny","Position":[44.719149,5.243386],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"France","City":"Vercheny"}{"Ascents":42,"Id":34889,"Name":"Manly","Position":[-33.80593,151.27281],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"Australia","City":""}{"Ascents":28,"Id":34901,"Name":"Mantarkaya","Position":[37.32076,34.97223],"Info":"1000 meter hıgh.

Falesia di Airale: Consigli per l'uso.\rOggi con la chiodatura delle ultime due linee, sono finiti i lavori di chiodatura e disgaggio/pulizia pesante del nuovo settore. Esso si chiama Zampa, ovvero il soprannome che fú di Andrea Ghiardi, guida alpina e amico di tanti scalatori prematuramente scomparso. Fu proprio lui all'inizio degli anni 90 a tracciare i primi tiri, su imbeccata di Silvio Mantoan altra compianta figura emblematica, se non fondamentale per lo sviluppo dell'arrampicata nella bassa valle d'aosta. Ci fu poi Cello (talentuoso scalatore che abitava proprio ad Airale) e co. che provarono in anni piú recenti a far decollare il posto, ma tanté che questi bei tiri aspettavano nell' oblio. Essi hanno lo stile classico di quei tempi, con prese scavate che oggi possono apparire un po' demodé, ma chi li ha pensati é stato uno scalatore di razza, e vedrete che risulteranno decisamente belli da scalare. Altri tiri sono stati aggiunti ora con la completa pulizia e richiodatura della falesia cercando peró come si usa ora di lasciare la roccia piú integra possibile.\rQuesto lavoro oltre che dal sottoscritto é stato eseguito da Jonny Pitti e famiglia, e Da Ilario del bar di montestrutto che hanno fanno un lavoro di pulizia direi pazzesco!\rInoltre la idea di ripristino della falesia arriva proprio dal bar \"Vertical Rock\" dal negozio \"xlmountain\" e dal campeggio di \"Quincinetto\" che hanno finanziato tutto il materiale.\rQualche tiro é giá stato liberato altri attendono a braccia aperte i futuri liberatori e salitori. La falesia é nuova e i tiri ancora da pulire in maniera definitiva, quindi non dimenticate la spazzola a casa e non arrabbiatevi troppo se puó capitare che vi resti qualcosa in mano. I gradi sono tutti da confermare ed é gradito il vostro parere magari lasciandolo scritto a Danilo (xlmountain) o Ilario \"vertical rock\" con una buona birra in mano.","Access":"Per arrivare alla falesia passiamo CON IL MASSIMO rispetto nella frazione e su terreni di altri.

The routes varies between 20m and 100m (including the multi-pitch) and are rated between 5b and 8a.\r\rIn total there are 6 sectors for sports-climbing and an honorary mention should go to Filipe Cardinal for developing a majority of the routes. Providing slabs, vertical and overhangs the sector are; Café, Fonte, Capela, Sonho Interrompido, Sauve Prestações, Veranda and Aço. The four former are the easiest accessible ones and also fits beginners the most, while the latter three sectors are either accessed by climbing other routes or rappel, and host most of the harder routes that the area can offer. Be aware that rock can be loose on some routes so wearing a helmet is good. \r\rIt's worth noticing that the Café-sector (that takes it's name from a nice little coffee near by) is on the north-eastern side of the river, and that except Fonte and Capela you'll need to walk up by the Chapel on a dirt-road about 150m before turning right into the forest in order to access the routes.\r\rThe Classical lines of Senhora Do Salto are all in the Fraga Do Cavalo sector and count about 14 in total. Ranging from 5-7a, most of them are 3 pitches and some use the same belay stations with variations in line taken per pitch. \r\rSeason; climbing can in theory happen all year, although spring, early-and-late summer and autumn are best. Most of the bolted lines does not receive sun before in late afternoon so climbing is possible in hot conditions, but due to both location and drainage from terrain above;  the routes needs at least 2-3 days to dry up after sustained rain in normal temperatures. \r\rHave fun...","Access":"","Country":"Portugal","City":"Porto/Valongo"}{"Ascents":1759,"Id":16603,"Name":"Loddefjord","Position":[60.36253535843458,5.237817764282227],"Info":"Developed by (year):\rMainly developed from 1990 to 1994.

La falesia è stata nel 2013 completamente richiodata e rimessa in sesto dallassociazione Salento Verticale con laiuto dei mitici Ragni di Lecco, attrezzando prevalentemente con tasselli ad espansione (fix).

Winter is best for hard routes and can offer surprisingly good conditions in the sun on the relatively warm dark grey rock. Summer is for softmovers, although shady sectors with cooling cracks can offer a welcome respite from the summer heat. \r\rVisit www.Klettern-Ettringen.de for an up-to-date route-database and monthly newsletters about what's going on in the quarries. \r\rHave fun!","Access":"","Country":"Germany","City":"Koblenz"}{"Ascents":426,"Id":29919,"Name":"Puerto rico","Position":[36.54163950596125,-4.884624481201172],"Info":"Take the A7 motorway and exit at Ojén A-355.

Winters are cold with snow from December until February. Summers are either warm (30C) and dry or rainy. But you can find enough shady places for the hot summer days because a lot of crags are in the woods.\r\rSeveral excellent camping sites can be found. Pottenstein for example. Climb when you exit your tent, cos the Bärenschluchtwände are at the campsite itself!\r\rThe meeting point for climbers is the campground in Untertrubach, opposite of the Zehnerstein. Everybody knows it as Oma Eichler. Obviously you can camp here. There are several other campsites in the neighbourhood. Cheap accomodation (appartments or local guesthouses) are easy to find.\r\rIn the lower grades (up to 6b) the protection is not good. Although there are some good exceptions. And using nuts and friends can be fun.\r\rA guidebook and a road map/satnav system for the area are essential to get the most out of your time here. Kletterführer Frankenjura Band 1 and Band 2 from Sebastian Schwertner/Panico Verlag cover the whole area. Frankenjura Extreme from the same author in English is a selected guidebook with more than 2000 routes mostly in the harder grades above 7a.

Local climbers flock here during the colder months, when Rifle is out of season. The rock is Sawatch Sandstone - think Glenwood Canyon - but seems to be a particular choice band. There's choss here, especially at the start of routes, but the significant traffic has gone a long way toward making the cliff safer. Nevertheless, be careful of rockfall here, especially during the times of melting or rain, when stones large and small plummet from the loose slopes above the cliff. Main Elk routes are generally more technical and fingery than those at Rifle, but heinous crimping is thankfully rare. Variety is one of the crag's best attributes: you'll find slabs, roofs, overhanging walls, cracks, dihedrals, and aretes.

Già conosciuta negli anni 70 per la scalata in artif, larrampicata sportiva approda in questo luogo tra la fine degli anni 80 e linizio dei 90s con i talentuosi Nardi, Gallo, Branca e il primo chiodatore Mochino. Dal 1992 vige il divieto darrampicata e chiodatura, nel 2005 viene attrezzata una via Ferrata. Si torna a scalare qui solo dopo il 2010, grazie alla ri-chiodatura discreta da parte di un anonimo che completa il lavoro del Troba, iniziato anni prima e immediatamente fermato dai guardia parco.\rLe difficoltà vanno dal 6b+ al 8a+/b, lo stile è quello della scalata in continuità su strapiombo. La roccia è caratterizzata da buchi di varie dimensioni, spesso distanti tra di loro, che rendono la scalata molto impegnativa, divertente ed estetica. E consigliabile scalare qui durante i periodi caldi dellanno, prestando attenzione al torrente che scorre alla base di tutti i monotiri.","Access":"","Country":"Italy","City":"Chianocco"}{"Ascents":66,"Id":31467,"Name":"Aspe","Position":[38.3465,-0.79857],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"España","City":""}{"Ascents":875,"Id":27691,"Name":"Roaches","Position":[53.1571998821792,-1.9922268390655518],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"United Kingdom","City":""}{"Ascents":47,"Id":30816,"Name":"Chiavolino","Position":[45.59046771807765,7.987489700317383],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"Italy","City":""}{"Ascents":118,"Id":29941,"Name":"White buddha","Position":[50.865344630175976,-114.81605529785156],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"Canada","City":""}{"Ascents":461,"Id":27755,"Name":"Møtteveggen","Position":[60.44307427417722,4.970712661743164],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"Norway","City":"Bergen"}{"Ascents":3681,"Id":28045,"Name":"Triangular lake","Position":[61.10842012499412,29.16595458984375],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"Russia","City":"Svetogorsk, Vyborg."}{"Ascents":628,"Id":28337,"Name":"Independence pass","Position":[39.12473362566029,-106.66213989257812],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"United States","City":"Aspen, Colorado"}{"Ascents":834,"Id":30222,"Name":"Cumberland","Position":[39.65328414777011,-78.7445068359375],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"United States","City":""}{"Ascents":1115,"Id":29349,"Name":"Cabezon de oro","Position":[38.52412999288265,-0.4113006591796875],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"España","City":"Alicante"}{"Ascents":118,"Id":28709,"Name":"Curbar","Position":[53.277531880460636,-1.632843017578125],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"United Kingdom","City":""}{"Ascents":98,"Id":28486,"Name":"El arenal","Position":[20.761250430919652,-103.6834716796875],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"Mexico","City":"Pachuca"}{"Ascents":502,"Id":27817,"Name":"Curucaca","Position":[-25.417190999191206,-49.72270488739014],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"Brazil","City":"Balsa Nova"}{"Ascents":34,"Id":36288,"Name":"Makita - zbrojnica","Position":[49.23342,18.21301],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"Slovakia","City":"Lazov pod Makytou"}{"Ascents":969,"Id":22339,"Name":"Caçapava do sul","Position":[-30.54602318259079,-53.54654788970947],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"Brazil","City":"Caçapava do Sul - RS"}{"Ascents":5,"Id":36697,"Name":"Blaueis","Position":[47.585787,12.868387],"Info":"","Access":"","Country":"Germany","City":"Ramsau"}{"Ascents":987,"Id":469,"Name":"Helleneset","Position":[60.43439886175703,5.280389785766602],"Info":"Mainly slab and vertical climbing. \rDeveloped by Bergen Climbing Club (ca 1990);\rGuidebook \"Klatrefører for Bergen\" is sold at Ute, Platou Sport and Bergen Turlag in the center of Bergen.

Depois de passar pela Polícia Rodoviária Federal de Serra, marque 4km no odômetro. No próxomo posto à direita, entre na rotarória e tome à esquerda para Calogi. Siga pelo pararelepipedo até o primeiro trevo. No trevo tome à direita e siga sempre pela principal. Na venda siga reto, não entre à esquerda. A essa altura já é possível de se avistar a pedra. Atravesse o trilho de trem e na bifurcação seguinte tome à direita (à esquerda segue para Santa Leopoldina). Siga pela estrada até uma porteira grande. Se a porteira estiver trancada, estacione o carro por ai mesmo e siga caminhando. Se a porteira estiver destravada, continue pela estrada. Próximo a uma casa azul, entre à esquerda numa estrada secudária por dentro do cafezal. Suba por essa estrada precária (veja no mapa) até o ponto mais alto e estacione o carro. Não tente subir direto pelo caminho mais curto, pois nesse trecho, pois a estrada está em péssimas condições. Dali, entre no cafezal e procure por duas bananeiras (+toten de pedra) na entrada da mata. Entre na mata e siga por uma trilha mal sinalizada em direção à pedra. Assim que encontrar a pedra, siga beirando a pedra para esquerda em direção ao setor do Totem.\r\rSe na hora de descer a porteira estiver trancada, volte até a casa azul e solicite a chave da porteira.\r\rMELHOR ÉPOCA\r\rA melhor época é durante o inverno quando chove menos.

Recomenda-se atenção redobrada quanto a isso. Algumas vias são bem longas, superando 25m. Por isso, muita atenção durante o rapel.\r\rPROTEÇÃO\r\rA maioria das vias estão equipadas com chapeletas e chumbadores de 3/8pol. Outras vias são mistas. Informe-se antes de entrar.
